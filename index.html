                <h2 class="calibre2">Introduction</h2>

                <p class="pcalibre calibre8">
                    With a title like Resilient Web Design, you might think that
                    this is a handbook for designing robust websites. This is
                    not a handbook. It’s more like a history book.
                </p>

                <p class="calibre8">Marshall McLuhan once said:</p>

                <blockquote class="calibre9">
                    <p class="calibre10">
                        We look at the present through a rear-view mirror. We
                        march backwards into the future.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="calibre8">
                    But in the world of web design, we are mostly preoccupied
                    with the here and now. When we think beyond our present
                    moment, it is usually to contemplate the future—to imagine
                    the devices, features, and interfaces that don’t yet exist.
                    We don’t have time to look back upon our past, and yet the
                    history of web design is filled with interesting ideas.
                </p>

                <p class="calibre8">
                    The World Wide Web has been around for long enough now that
                    we can begin to evaluate the twists and turns of its
                    evolution. I wrote this book to highlight some of the
                    approaches to web design that have proven to be resilient. I
                    didn’t do this purely out of historical interest (although I
                    am fascinated by the already rich history of our young
                    industry). In learning from the past, I believe we can
                    better prepare for the future.
                </p>

                <p class="calibre8">
                    You won’t find any code in here to help you build better
                    websites. But you will find ideas and approaches. Ideas are
                    more resilient than code. I’ve tried to combine the most
                    resilient ideas from the history of web design into an
                    approach for building the websites of the future.
                </p>

                <p class="calibre8">
                    I hope you will join me in building a web that lasts; a web
                    that’s resilient.
